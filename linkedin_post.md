🚀 Just completed an **AI-Powered Multi-Agent System for Power System Analysis** - and I'm excited to share what makes it special!

## The Architecture 🏗️

Built a sophisticated hierarchical multi-agent system:
• **Orchestrator Layer**: LLM-powered query classifier that intelligently routes requests
• **Power Flow Coordinator**: Manages complex multi-step computational workflows
• **Specialized Agents**: Ybus calculations, Gauss-Seidel solver, fault analysis, loss computation
• **Seamless Chaining**: Agents automatically chain operations (Branch Data → Ybus → Power Flow → Loss)

## Why It's Cool 🤖

**1. Intelligent Orchestration**
The system uses tool calling to enable agents to automatically determine what computations are needed, chain operations, and maintain conversation context - all without manual intervention.

**2. MATLAB Integration** 🔬
This is where it gets interesting! Created a Python-MATLAB bridge that:
• Executes MATLAB scripts directly from Python agents
• Handles complex number conversions automatically
• Combines Python's flexibility with MATLAB's numerical computing power
• Perfect for engineering computations that need both AI reasoning and precise numerical methods

**3. Multimodal & Context-Aware** ✨
• Upload circuit diagrams and get intelligent analysis
• Maintains conversation memory for follow-up questions
• Web search integration for broader power system knowledge
• Beautiful Streamlit chat interface

## The Impact

This demonstrates how modern AI can transform complex engineering workflows - making power system analysis more accessible while maintaining computational accuracy through seamless MATLAB integration.

Built over 6 weeks using Python, Groq API (Llama models), MATLAB Engine API, and Streamlit.

What do you think? Have you worked on similar multi-agent systems or MATLAB integrations? I'd love to hear your thoughts! 💬
